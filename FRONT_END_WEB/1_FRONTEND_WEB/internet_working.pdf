How Actually internet works?
  ->This is the question that i personally think in old days.
  but now i know the exact answer of this.

  Internet is nothing but a long giant wire, which is connected with all the computers.

  (*) Also there was some special computer called server.
  it's works differently.It save all the website data and store it as a ip address.

  (*)Now how actually we se something on internet? when we request something to our internet service provider (jio) then request goes to DNA server then it goes through the giant wire to the server.

  then server return the exact ip address for this required website.

  And we view our website through this ip address.
