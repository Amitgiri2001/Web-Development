For learn any kind of backend language we need to learn CRUD operation

like:Create Read Write and Delete from our data base

1.Create table in SQL:
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1 datatype,
        column2 datatype,
        column3 datatype,
      ....
    );

3.insert in table:
            INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

        2. If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:

            INSERT INTO table_name
            VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

2.Read from our database:
        SELECT * FROM products (for all the data printed in products table)

    ----->for a particular column to be printed:
        SELECT name,price FROM products (the column name and price is printed)

    ---------->for particular row to be printed:
        SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=1 (for print where id==1)
3.Update:

    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;

    UPDATE products
    SET price=0.9
    where id=2

    if we want to update a whole column / create a new col:
        ALTER TABLE table_name
        ADD column_name datatype;

4.Delete:
        DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;



------------> Relationships <--------------------

use forign key for building Relationships

    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        OrderID int NOT NULL,
        OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
        PersonID int,
        PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
        FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
    );


    inner join: link->https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp
    
        SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table1
        INNER JOIN table2
        ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
