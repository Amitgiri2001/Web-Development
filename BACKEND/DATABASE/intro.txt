How to store data into internet?
    we can do that simply using database like 
    sql or nosql database.

    sql-> structured query language (Relationship)
    nosql: not only structured query language (No Relationship)

    sql: 1.save data in a table
        2.vertically scalable
        3.make good Relationship
        .ex:MySQL,posteSQL

    nosql: 1.save data in a document json formeted
        2.Horizontally scalable
        3.don't make good Relationship
        .ex:Mongodb,redix
