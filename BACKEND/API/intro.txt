    ->> js object and JSON format is ery similar

    const obj={
        name:"Amit",
        roll:2,
        class:5
    }

    const json={
        "name":"Amit",
        "roll":2,
        "class:5
    }

    we can convert obj to json by using JSON.stringify(obj)
    we can convert json to obj by using JSON.parse(obj)

    ____>> always remember that first we need to convert json data into object before work in it


Request setting for api call------------->
    let base = "https://apiv2.bitcoinaverage.com/indices/global/ticker/";

    //final may be a object that should contain url: and method:
    let final = base + first + second;
    request(final, function (err, res, body) {
        // console.log(res.statusCode);
        // console.log(body)
        // result.send(body);

        const obj = JSON.parse(body);
        console.log( obj.last);
        console.log(obj.averages.week);
    });
