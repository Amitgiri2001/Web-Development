*.Node.js works in server and compute the request and send what we wanted. And It allow us to access local files directly.

introduction of Hyper terminal:
    1.pwd               : print current directory
    2.cd Desktop/       : change directory to Desktop
    3.touch index.js    : Create a index.js file in this folder

    4. cd .             : Open this folder in vs code
    5.node index.js     : Run index.js file
    6.ls                : list of files and folder that exists this directory.

***.node REPL(Read Evolution Print Loop): that means in hyper or simply vs code terminal we can write js code and execute them by using node commend.

    7.node
        >console.log("Hello World");
        o/p:"Hello World"
        >3+7
        o/p:10
        >"Amit " + "Giri"
        o/p:"Amit Giri"
        (for exit from REPL we need to run .exit commend or press ctrl+c 2 times)
    
*. for working with node.js go to documentation of node.js in nodejs.org

folder-> intro-to_node (here we are doing some native node.js work -> here we don't need to install node_modules at all)
